-- Instructions
-- You are going to practice tables relationships

-- Part I
-- Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.

-- A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
-- The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
-- The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)

CREATE TABLE customer (
	customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL,
	last_name VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE customer_profile (
	customer_profile_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
	is_logged_in BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
	customer_id INT NOT NULL,
	
	CONSTRAINT fk_customer_id FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customer(customer_id)
)


-- Insert those customers
-- John, Doe
-- Jerome, Lalu
-- Lea, Rive

INSERT INTO customer (first_name, last_name) VALUES 
('John', 'Doe'),
('Jerome', 'Lalu'),
('Lea', 'Rive')

-- Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries
-- John is loggedIn
-- Jerome is not logged in

INSERT INTO customer_profile (is_logged_in, customer_id) VALUES
(TRUE, 1),
(FALSE, 2)

-- Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

-- The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
SELECT customer.first_name FROM customer
INNER JOIN customer_profile
ON customer.customer_id = customer_profile.customer_id
WHERE customer_profile.is_logged_in = TRUE

-- All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.
SELECT customer.first_name, customer_profile.is_logged_in FROM customer
FULL JOIN customer_profile
ON customer.customer_id = customer_profile.customer_id

-- The number of customers that are not LoggedIn
SELECT COUNT(customer_profile.is_logged_in) FROM customer
INNER JOIN customer_profile
ON customer.customer_id = customer_profile.customer_id
WHERE customer_profile.is_logged_in = FALSE


-- Part II:

-- Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

CREATE TABLE book (
	book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
	title VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL, 
	author VARCHAR (50) NOT NULL
)

-- Insert those books :
-- Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
-- Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
-- To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

INSERT INTO book (title, author) VALUES
('Alice in Wonderland', 'Lewis Carroll'),
('Harry Potter', 'J.K Rowling'),
('To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Harper Lee')

-- Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

CREATE TABLE student (
	student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
	name VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
	age INT NOT NULL CHECK (age between 0 and 15)
)

-- Insert those students:
-- John, 12
-- Lera, 11
-- Patrick, 10
-- Bob, 14

INSERT INTO student (name, age) VALUES
('John', 12),
('Lera', 11),
('Patrick', 10),
('Bob', 14)

-- Create a table named Library, with the columns :
-- book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- borrowed_date
-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

CREATE TABLE library (
	book_id INT, CONSTRAINT fk_book_id FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES book(book_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	student_id INT, CONSTRAINT fk_student_id FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	borrowed_date date NOT NULL
)

-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
INSERT INTO library (book_id, student_id, borrowed_date) VALUES
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title =  'Alice in Wonderland'), (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name =  'John'), '2022-02-15')

-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
INSERT INTO library (book_id, student_id, borrowed_date) VALUES
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title =  'To Kill a Mockingbird'), (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name =  'Bob'), '2021-03-03')

-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
INSERT INTO library (book_id, student_id, borrowed_date) VALUES
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title =  'Alice in Wonderland'), (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name =  'Lera'), '2023-05-23')

-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021
INSERT INTO library (book_id, student_id, borrowed_date) VALUES
((SELECT book_id FROM book WHERE title =  'Harry Potter'), (SELECT student_id FROM student WHERE name =  'Bob'), '2021-08-12')


-- Display the data
-- Select all the columns from the junction table
-- Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
-- Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland
-- Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?
